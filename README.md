1. *Type Casting & If-Else:*
   - Take a user input as a string. If it represents an integer, convert it to an integer and check if it's even or odd. If it's a float, print its square.

2. *User Input & Conditional Operators:*
   - Ask the user for two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Perform the operation and print the result.

3. *Data Types & If-Else:*
   - Declare a variable and check if it's a string. If true, print its length; if false, check if it's an integer and print its square.

4. *Type Casting & User Input:*
   - Take a user input as a number. Convert it to a float, then to an integer, and finally back to a string. Print the final result.

5. *If-Else & Conditional Operators:*
   - Ask the user for their age. If it's between 18 and 25 (inclusive), print "Young Adult," otherwise print "Not a Young Adult."

6. *Data Types & If-Else:*
   - Create a list containing a mix of integers and strings. Check if the first element is an integer and print its square, otherwise print the length of the list.

7. *Type Casting & User Input:*
   - Take two numbers as input, one integer and one float. Multiply them and print the result as a float.

8. *If-Else & Conditional Operators:*
   - Ask the user to input a grade (A, B, C, D, or F). Determine and print if it's a passing grade (A, B, C).

9. *User Input & Data Types:*
   - Prompt the user for a sentence. Check if it contains the word "Python" and print a message accordingly.

10. *Data Types & Conditional Operators:*
    - Declare a variable and check if it's a positive integer. If true, print "Positive integer," otherwise check if it's a negative integer and print "Negative integer."

11. *If-Else & Type Casting:*
    - Ask the user for their birth year and calculate their age. If the age is greater than 18, print "You are an adult."

12. *User Input & Data Types:*
    - Take a user input as a comma-separated string of numbers. Convert it into a list of integers and find the sum.

13. *Conditional Operators & If-Else:*
    - Ask the user for two numbers and check if their sum is greater than, equal to, or less than 100. Print the result.

14. *Type Casting & Data Types:*
    - Take a user input as a number, convert it to a float, and then check if the decimal part is greater than 0.5. Print the result.

15. *Data Types & User Input:*
    - Create a tuple with different data types. Ask the user to input an index and print the corresponding element.

16. *If-Else & Type Casting:*
    - Take a user input as a number. Check if it's divisible by both 3 and 5. If true, print "Divisible by 3 and 5," otherwise print "Not divisible by 3 and 5."

17. *Conditional Operators & Data Types:*
    - Declare a variable and check if it's a non-empty string. If true, print "String is not empty," otherwise print "String is empty."

18. *Type Casting & If-Else:*
    - Take a user input as a string. If it can be converted to an integer, check if it's even or odd. If it's a float, print its square root.

19. *User Input & Data Types:*
    - Ask the user to enter a sentence. Count and print the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the sentence.

20. *If-Else & Conditional Operators:*
    - Take three numbers from the user and find the minimum among them. If the minimum is less than 10, print "Below 10," otherwise
